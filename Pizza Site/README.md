<h1>Pizza Site with JavaScript Shopping Cart Calculator.</h1>

<p>Created from scratch a pizza website for the imaginary Yogi's Pizza where you can select a pizza size and add/subtract different toppings that then adjusts the shopping cart calculator when press Place Order.</p>

<p>To view site, click <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DevJHennessy/Tech-Academy-Projects/blob/master/Pizza%20Site/index.html">here</a>. Note: the GitHub Previewer has a bug and does not like the relative URL usage for CSS images. To make the background show up properly, inspect the page with developer tools and navigate to the body element and delete one of the periods for the URL in the background-image property - should look like: background-image: url(./Images/Pizza_9.jpg); </p>
