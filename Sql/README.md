<h1>Community Library Database</h1>

<p>A SQL Server Database of four libraries populated with books, authors, publishers, borrowers, books loaned out, number of book copies each library has stocked, and the library branches. I've created seven stored procedures that demonstrate queries of various levels of difficulty. The first retrieves the number of copies of The Lost Tribe owned by library branch Sharpstown. The second gets the number of copies of The Lost Tribe owned by each library branch. The third shows the names of borrowers who do not currently have any books checked out. The fourth retrieves the book title, plus borrower's name and address where borrowed from Sharpstown branch and due date is today. The fifth gets the branch name and number of books currently loaned out from each branch. The sixth retrieves the names, addresses, and number of books checked out for borrowers with more than five books out. And the seventh retrieves book titles of Stephen King's books, and the number of copies, only at the Central library branch.</p>
